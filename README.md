# Grain_Restoration
This program is used to restore the grain shape from the image of a grannular rock sample where some grains are partially overlapped with eachother.
Input is a binary image with two phases of grain and pore
The outputs are an image in which every grain boundary is labelled, and a .txt file contains all calculated properties for each grain. 
Five pictures are provided in this case denoted by demon1.png,...,demon5.png
Directly run the python code, overlap_convex_particles_separate.py. please change the address of the image where you stored in the 1115th line of the python code.
